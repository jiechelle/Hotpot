	<p>Hot pot is a literal translation from 火锅 (Huo Guo)in Chinese, "火 meaning fire and "锅" meaning pot, (also known as steamboat in Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines, China, and Brunei),[citation needed] refers to several East Asian varieties of stew, consisting of a simmering metal pot of stock at the center of the dining table. While the hot pot is kept simmering, ingredients are placed into the pot and are cooked at the table. Typical hot pot dishes include thinly sliced meat, leaf vegetables, mushrooms, wontons, egg dumplings, and seafood. The cooked food is usually eaten with a dipping sauce. Hot pot meals are usually eaten in the winter during supper time. </p>
